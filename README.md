# Exam-year

Welcome to my journey of exploring design practice during my current semester in my senior year. On this page, I will document my process, experiences, and reflections as I execute my practice plan. This includes continuous experimentation, learning, and critical thinking about my role as a designer.

I will also include snapshots of the work I am creating, from digital and physical designs to practical implementations of interactive elements. This page serves as a reflection space for my final presentations and my ongoing development of ideas and skills.
